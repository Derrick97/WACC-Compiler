(** An Intermediate language similar to ILOC
   The goal of the designing this IR is two fold
   1) we desugar as much information as possible from the frontend.
   2) we provide good representation for data-flow analysis,
    optimisation and code generation.

    One design requirement is to make control flow explicit in the IR.
    Hence, for branch instructions, all branches must be explicitly present in
    the instructions

    We use a small subset of the ILOC IR, which is introduced
    in the book Engineering a Compiler.
